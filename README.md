# Instruments V robots
## Introduction
Insruments V robots is a 2D tower defense game with a similar lay out to plants versus zombies. It is the first game of a larger scale I want to create.
## How to play
The game is a tower defense strategy where players place different musical instruments to defend their base against waves of robots with varying strengths. Instruments serve as defensive, offensive, or money-generating units. A unique twist is that bullets passing through other instruments gain buffs based on the type they pass through. Money-generating instruments offer the most powerful buffs, forcing players to decide whether to place them safely at the back or risk them being destroyed for stronger offensive boosts.
